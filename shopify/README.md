# Or... just use Fiber ðŸ›œ

Reading 10,000 orders from a Shopify store will take you 5-10 minutes. For
clients of any decent size, you will need not only long-running processes but a
sophisticated system for saving state when things inevitably go wrong.

## To-dos

- [x] Load first page from products, orders & customers
- [x] Load all the pages
- [x] Validate the schema of the objects we receive
